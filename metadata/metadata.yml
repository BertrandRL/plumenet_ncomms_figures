name: Automatic Detection of Methane Emissions in Multispectral Satellite Imagery
  Using a Vision Transformer
description: Here we show that deep learning can be leveraged to overcome the trade-off
  in terms of spectral resolution that comes with multi-spectral satellite data, resulting
  in a methane detection tool with global coverage and high temporal and spatial resolution.
  We compare our detections with airborne methane measurement campaigns. Our results
  suggest that our method is able to detect  methane point sources in Sentinel-2 multi-spectral
  satellite data down to plumes of 0.01 km2, corresponding to 200 to 300 kg CH4/h
  sources (with variations depending on wind conditions). The assessment of our model
  on synthetic data as well as on real methane plumes results in an order of magnitude
  improvement over the state-of-the-art, providing a significant step towards the
  automated, high resolution detection of methane emissions at a global scale, every
  few days.
